        <p>
            Being a lawer is my dream job.A lawyer is a person in where, people deal with justice and helping others to get their rights. They can help people from any kind problem. There are law's all over the world and one should definitely follow it and when someone disobeys or creates problems for others, then people need a lawyer to help them fight for justice.
